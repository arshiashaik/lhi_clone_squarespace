# 🌍 Lifting Hands International – Squarespace 7.1 Inspired Website (Clone)

A custom-built, structure-inspired nonprofit website using **Squarespace 7.1**, based on the original site of **Lifting Hands International**. While the site follows the same general structure (sections, pages, navigation), the layout, design, and content presentation have been **entirely customized** to demonstrate creative flexibility and design thinking within the Squarespace platform.

> **⏱️ Note:**  

> This project was completed in **just a day and a half** to meet an application deadline for a web developer position.  
> Due to time constraints and the high number of nested pages, **some internal links still point to the original site**. The goal was to **showcase my Squarespace 7.1 skills**, creative layout adaptation, and efficient handling of large-scale site architecture, while avoiding repetitive duplication of similar content blocks.
